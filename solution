Solution Approach
A comprehensive implementation using the Next-Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) packing algorithm

Packing Algorithm: NFDH (Next-Fit Decreasing Height)
Why NFDH?
•
Simple & Efficient: Easy to implement with good performance
•
Height Sorting: Packs larger images first for better space utilization
•
Row-Based: Creates horizontal shelves, fitting images left-to-right
•
Proven Results: Typically achieves 70-80% space efficiency
How it Works:
Sort images by height (tallest first)
Create a new shelf (row) for the first image
Try to fit next image on current shelf
If it doesn't fit, create a new shelf below
When page is full, create a new page
Implementation Breakdown
Step 1
Image Preprocessing
Load images, remove transparent backgrounds, crop to bounding box of visible content, and maintain original aspect ratios.

PIL.Image → convert('RGBA') → crop to bbox → save processed
Step 2
Dimension Calculation
Calculate scaled dimensions to fit on PDF page (A4: 210mm × 297mm) while preserving aspect ratios. Add margins and padding.

scale_factor = min(max_width/img_width, max_height/img_height)
Step 3
NFDH Packing
Sort images by height, pack into shelves using Next-Fit Decreasing Height algorithm, and create new pages when needed.

for img in sorted_images: place_on_shelf_or_create_new()
Step 4
PDF Generation
Use ReportLab to create PDF pages, draw images at calculated positions, and optionally compress images for smaller file size.
